# Elastic SIEM Home Lab

This project walks you through setting up a home lab for **Elastic Stack Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** using the **Elastic Cloud** platform and a **Kali Linux** virtual machine (VM). The goal of this project is to generate security events on the Kali VM, forward them to the Elastic SIEM instance, and analyze the logs.
